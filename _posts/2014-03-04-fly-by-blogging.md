What to do while you fly to <a href="http://qconlondon.com/">QCon London 2014</a>? Perhaps one could try some on the air publishing with <a
href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and Github? <a href="http://www.norwegian.com/uk/travel-information/travel-services/wifi/">Norwegian
has free Wi-Fi</a> and as I am not in the office or at home there are no interruptions like real work I might try to finally set up a new
version of my blog to be ready for QCon.

What to see in QCon then? Agile, smagile, I'll leave selecting the tracks and presentations to the Last Responsible Momentâ„¢ so no BDUF here
 but at least these sound interesting:

* Bodil Stokke: "What Every Hipster Should Know About Functional Reactive Programming" (My kids tell me constantly that I'm a hipster so I
should check this one out.)
* Brian Degenhardt: "Real-Time Systems at Twitter" (I guess their systems can get sometimes quite busy, #Crimea, #Oscars, #bi-winning)
* Chris Mattmann from NASA has two presentations about Big Data that I hope will space me out. Is universe NoSQL?
* Erik Meijer: "Contravariance is the Dual of Covariance Implies Iterable is the Dual of Observable(, What's the Problem?)"
* Graham Tackley: "How Elasticsearch Powers the Guardian's Newsroom" (Sorry, no funny comment for this one.)
* Ian Robinson: "New Opportunities for Connected Data" (MongoDB is so old-skool.)
* Joe Armstrong: "Fault Tolerance 101" (I remember how Joe described his horror when he heard that it is even possible to imagine a
concept like "not thread-safe" when he was learning Java.)
* Tim Bray: "Does the Browser have a Future?" (Last time I was at QCon I saw Sir Tony Hoare, the inventor of the null reference. And now
they have the inventor of XML. Not going to miss this one.)
